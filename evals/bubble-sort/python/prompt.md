# Bubble Sort Tasks — Python

Implement a bubble sort function for task records.

## Requirements

Write a single file `bubble_sort.py` containing a function with this exact signature:

```python
def bubble_sort_tasks(tasks: list[dict]) -> tuple[list[dict], int]:
```

Each task dictionary has these keys:
- `"name"`: `str` — task name
- `"priority"`: `int` or `None` — task priority
- `"created_at"`: `int` — unix timestamp

### Sorting Rules

1. **Primary:** sort by `"priority"` descending (higher priority comes first)
2. **Tiebreaker:** when priorities are equal, sort by `"created_at"` ascending (earlier timestamp comes first)
3. **Null handling:** tasks where `priority` is `None` always sort to the end of the list, ordered by `"created_at"` ascending among themselves

### Constraints

- You must implement the bubble sort algorithm — do not use Python's built-in `sort()`, `sorted()`, or any other sorting function
- Return a tuple of `(sorted_list, swap_count)` where `swap_count` is the total number of element swaps performed during sorting
- Do not modify the original input list — return a new list

### Example

```python
tasks = [
    {"name": "bug",     "priority": 3, "created_at": 1000},
    {"name": "feature", "priority": 5, "created_at": 2000},
    {"name": "docs",    "priority": 3, "created_at": 500},
]

sorted_tasks, swaps = bubble_sort_tasks(tasks)
# sorted_tasks = [
#     {"name": "feature", "priority": 5, "created_at": 2000},
#     {"name": "docs",    "priority": 3, "created_at": 500},
#     {"name": "bug",     "priority": 3, "created_at": 1000},
# ]
# swaps = 2
```

Write clean, well-documented, idiomatic Python code. Include type hints and a docstring.
